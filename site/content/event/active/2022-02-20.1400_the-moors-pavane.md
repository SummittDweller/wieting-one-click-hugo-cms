Free event brought to us by **University of Iowa Artshare**

Although MOOR’S PAVANE  is subtitled “Variations on the theme of Othello”, this dance is not intended as a choreographic version of Shakespeare’s play. In the form of a pavane and other dances of the high Renaissance, the legend is told of the hapless Moor, his wrongfully suspected wife, the Moor’s treacherous friend and his wife. The four characters portray the tragedy of Everyman, and the ballet is, therefore, timeless in its implications. This work has been cited by critics the world over as José Limón’s “masterpiece.”

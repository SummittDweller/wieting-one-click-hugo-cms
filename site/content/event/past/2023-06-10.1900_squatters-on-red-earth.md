## **A drama about a peaceful encounter in the midst of the U.S. white settler land grab.**

The play is produced by Swander Woman Productions, a theatre company that creates and tours dramatic performances based on food, farming, and the wider rural environment.

This drama is enacted through the use of a crankie, a medieval puppetry device, designed and built by Shelley Buffalo (Meskwaki Settlement). Shadow puppets were made by Monica Leo of *Eulenspiegel Puppets* (West Liberty, IA). The music was composed and is performed by Laura Hudson Kitrell (Coralville, IA), and costumes were designed and made by Michele Payne Hinz (Cedar Rapids, IA). Brant Bollman from William Penn University (Oskaloosa, IA) directs. Rip Russell (Iowa City, IA) stars in the show with members of the Meskwaki Settlement School Youth Theatre Group.

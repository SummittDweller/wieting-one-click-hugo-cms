In 2016 the Wieting purchased and installed an `HIVI` system and corresponding equipment to comply with Federal regulations and requirements.  There are three components to said system...

  - A `QSC/USL UPC-28C` [IR Hearing System with Closed Caption](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiz84DWu9r4AhUAlIkEHXG4Dz4QFnoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qsc.com%2Fresource-files%2Fproductresources%2Fcin-accesssolutions%2Fupc_series_packages%2Fq_dn_usl_upc_28c_usermanual.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0_oQ8SA1dpUkOTWgU-WSDY) broadcast panel mounted high on the north-end of the wall outside the projection booth facing the screen.  This unit casts an infrared signal to the screen that is reflected to devices in the audience.
  - Four (4) pairs of over-the-ear headphones to provide amplified stereo sound for audience members.
  - Four (4) `QSC/USL CCR-100` [personal caption display with cupholder](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjNtM2Uutr4AhUNkIkEHVIzDgEQFnoECAUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-docs.av-iq.com%2Fother%2FUSL%2520CCR-100_User%2520Manual.pdf&usg=AOvVaw37t5Z7ff4My400b4CGE1R5) support devices.

_Note that `USL` changed their company name to [QSC](https://www.qsc.com/) in 2021_.

The headphones and `CCR-100` units are NOT meant to be used together!  Patrons should select one device or the other, not both.

## User Manuals

The [QSC/USL CCR-100 user manual](../../pdf/USL-CCR-100_User-Manual.pdf) is relatively short and the units reqiure regular maintenance so that manual is shown below.

The `QSC/USL UPC-28C` units should NOT require regular maintenance so a PDF copy of their [user/installation manual is provided for download only](../../pdf/q_dn_usl_upc_28c_usermanual.pdf). 

### QSC/USL CCR-100

{{% attention %}}
The `CCR-100` units reqiure two (2) AA batteries for power.  These may be either standard AA batteries or NiMH rechargables.  Since the Wieting doesn't see frequent use of these units it's likely that standard AA batteries are installed _and fresh batteries may need to be installed!_  Or, the batteries in the unit might include a wax paper seperator to keep them from discharging. Make sure you check the units before they are needed, and install new batteries as necessary, or remove any seperator you find.  A small Philips screwdriver is required to remove the battery compartment cover.

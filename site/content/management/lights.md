The Wieting's lightboard and house light controls are very complex and controlling them _reliably_ is NOT intuitive.  What follows is the process that I've used to reliably exchange control of the lights from the wall panels and cinema, to the theatre lightboard, and back again.

# Reliable Lightboard Operation 

**It's critical that ALL control operations be performed in the `projection booth` and on the `lightboard` just outside the booth.**  Interacting with other light controls in the theatre (back-stage or in the ticket booth) may corrupt the process and require a complete reset of the system.

## Enabling Theatre Lighting Control

Instruments typically used in live productions and other non-cinema operations should be controlled from the lightboard.  There are limited configruations of some lights available from the ETC wall panels in the projection booth, backstage, and ticket booth, but full control should always be from the lightboard.  

To reliably enable theatre lights control please do the following:

  - Enter the projection booth and `turn on the booth lights` using the toggle switch near the door.  If you don't do this, you might find yourself fumbling in the dark very soon.
  - Now, press `preset button 4` to ensure the light panel in the booth has control.  As I understand it, this circuit does NOTHING, but ensure that control is relinquished to the lightboard.  
  - Next, `press the OFF button in the lower-right corner of the light control panel` in the booth wall.  The corresponding indicator light on the control panel should glow green to indicate that THIS panel "has control" and all house lights should be off/dark.
  - Move outside the booth to the lightboard, turn the `control desk on, and make sure the lightboard is plugged in to power AND the DMX connector is plugged into the west wall behind the desk/chair.`
  - All of the `lightboard slider controls should be DOWN (full off).`  If they are not, bring them down now!
  - `Power the lightboard up` if it's not already on.
  - Bring all of the `relay switches, sliders 9 through 20, up full`.  This will turn on all of the light control relays.  Without these switches turned "on" you won't have power to any of the theatre lights.
  - Now `engage remaining sliders 1 through 8, and 21 through 32 as-needed`.  These are dimmer controls so you can control the intensity of each light.  When they are engaged, the LED fixtures will also allow you to change colors.

## Returning Control to the Booth

When you are done using the lightboard `be sure to move ALL sliders down to the OFF position BEFORE you do anything else with the lightboard!`  Failure to do this will lock the house lights so they cannot be controlled from anywhere else.

Once all the lightboard controls are in the OFF position...

  - `Turn the lightboard off.`
  - `Unplug the lightboard power and the DMX connector` from the west wall.
  - `Turn off the light desk` if it is no longer needed. 
  - Return to the projection booth and `engage preset buttons 1 or 2` depending on the level you wish to run the house lights at.  This will give control back to the booth and other house light controllers.

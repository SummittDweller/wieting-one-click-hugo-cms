## Proper QSC DPM100 Sound Settings

{{< imgfig "/img/_DPM100.png" >}}

If the QSC DPM100 is ON but the display is dark, you may need to turn the `MONITOR VOLUME` knob to "wake up" the display (see image above).

Note that the `MASTER MUTE` red light shown in the image above should NEVER be ON.  If it is, please push the button below `MASTER MUTE` to turn the red indicator light OFF!

### Pre-Show Ads

During the first 15-20 minutes of the pre-show you should see advertisements and upcoming events shown in 15- or 30-second images on screen.  After the pre-show ads you'll see movie trailers and announcements.

When the pre-show ads are playing the QSC DPM100 display (see image above) should indicate:

  - Fader level approximately `-9.0 dB`
  - Mode `PR 4 :Non-Sync`
  
### Movie Trailers

During the second 15-20 minutes of the pre-show you should see movie trailers and announcements.  Before this section you'll see pre-show ads as described above.

When the movie trailers are playing the QSC DPM100 display (see image above) should indicate:

  - Fader level approximately `-9.0 dB`
  - Mode `PR 1 :Digital`

### Movie / Feature
 
When the movie/feature begins the QSC DPM100 display (see image above) should indicate:

  - Fader level approximately `-4.0 dB`
  - Mode `PR 1 :Digital`
  
# Correcting the DPM100 Sound Settings

If there is NO sound or if the WRONG sound is playing, use the two buttons to the right of the DPM100 display (see image above), and the `MONITOR VOLUME` knob, to make changes.

The following sequence is recommended:

  - Press the top `curled arrow` button.
  - Turn the `MONITOR VOLUME` knob to select the correct "mode".  This should be `PR 1 :Digital` during the trailers and during the movie.  The mode should be `PR 4 :Non-sync` during the pre-show ads (before the trailers).
  - Once the proper mode is displayed, press the bottom `select arrow` button to lock in the mode change.
  - Press the top `curled arrow` button again to complete the sequence.
  
  The display should change to show the selected mode and the sound you hear in the theatre should match this mode.
  
  When you change the mode the fader level should change automatically to that mode's default value.  This will generally be the correct value for the given mode.
  
# Changing the Volume (Fader)

To change the fader level turn the `MASTER VOLUME` to the desired level as indicated in the DPM100 display (see image above).  Note that you can only make 1.0 dB changes so some decimal numbers are not possible.  Just set the level as close to the target as possible, but remember that you should **ALWAYS CHOOSE A NEGATIVE FADER LEVEL**.  Positive values are VERY LOUD!

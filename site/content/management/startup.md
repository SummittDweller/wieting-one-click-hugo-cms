## Movie Startup Instruction for Managers

This is the manager startup workflow for our usual weekend movies.  Follow steps `A` through  `E` in order.

### A - Projector Power-Up

The projector is programmed to automatically power-up on weekends at `6:15 PM`.  If you enter the booth after that time you should see controls and projector "taillights" as seen in `A` above.  

**If you visit the booth before 6:15 PM *there is no harm in powering up the projector!**  Keep reading below.

If the projector control screen is dark, tap on it to wake it up.

If the projector is NOT powered-up, **tap and hold the green and white control button** in the upper right corner of the projector control screen.  The unit should power-up after a couple of seconds.

Complete projector start-up will take 3-4 minutes.  When complete the green taillights on the back of the projector should be lit.

### B - Pre-Show Power-Up

Once the projector taillights are green you should power-up the pre-show.  There are two switches labeled `B` in the diagram.  

If the power switch on the power strip is glowing red then the system is ready-to-go.  If it is not, toggle the two switches until the power strip light glows red.  

Once the power strip is on move to step `C` below.

### C - Content Power-Up

The content server should be left on at all times, but if the blue lights at `C` are NOT lit, check the small toggle switch near the lights.  Turn it on if necessary.

Move to the audio rack and step `D`.

### D - Power-Up the Amplifiers

On the audio rack engage all 6 of the amplifier power switches labled `D x 6` in the diagram.

### E - Audio Processor

The processor labeled `E` should already be on with information appearing in the small window.  If the window is dark try pressing either of the two buttons beside the window to wake it up. 

If the window remains dark check that power in step `B` is still on.  If it is off, repeat `B` and check again.  If it remains off call Mark @ 641-484-4471.

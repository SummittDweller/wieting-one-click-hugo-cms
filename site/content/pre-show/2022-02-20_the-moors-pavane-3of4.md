Graduate students Michael Landez and Juliet Remmers collaborated to curate this reconstruction of José Limón’s “The Moor’s Pavane,” as part of their culminating thesis research as dance MFA Candidates at the University of Iowa. The work is being approached as an inquisition to (re)presentation of historic embodiments of masculinity and femininity. With a new approach to reconstruction, former Limón dancer Kurt Douglas provided the ideal research environment to investigate contemporary embodiments of historic choreography. Together, Remmers and Landez hope this reconstruction brings forward a critical discussion about how bodies in the present day reinterpret historic conceptions of identity across gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality.

B﻿ack by popular demand!

The Basement Band starting at 4:00 pm! They play classic pop and rock hits along with other styles from the late 60’s to the early 2000’s that you’re sure to [](<>)know and love. Come for an afternoon of foot tapping and chair dancing music! Suggested donation of $5 per person to support the Wieting. The concert will be followed by a fundraising dinner from 5-7 featuring chicken pasta bake, sides and desserts for $10 (carryout available). Come and support local talent and the theatre!

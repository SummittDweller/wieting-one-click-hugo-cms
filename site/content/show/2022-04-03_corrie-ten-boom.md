Corrie ten Boom is a one person drama by Evelyn Hinds where “Corrie” tells her amazing story of imprisonment in a Nazi death camp, her release, and later travel around the world telling her story. Corrie was a gifted storyteller and her experiences and her faith have inspired generations! 

Corrie ten Boom (1892-1983) was a Dutch woman who became part of the underground workers in Holland during the Holocaust. She was honored by the Billy Graham Worldwide Pictures producing an award winning film of her life, “The Hiding Place.” Corrie’s family home is now a museum in Haarlem where people from all over the world come to see the home that the family used to hide the Jews from Hitler’s murderous plans.

We welcome The Basement Band for their first performance at the Wieting on Sunday, April 24th at 3:30 pm! You may recognize a few local faces such as Bert Evans, Mike Groh and STC grad, Mike Tingley. They are joined by band members Ben Cerka, Jen Hager, Tom Kirner, and Attila Szabo. Band members from The Menace, a group of Marshalltown co-workers and spouses, started jammin’ together about 15 years ago. Over time as members came and went, they've done fundraiser, party, campground, wedding and Vets home performances as The Garage Jam and now The Basement Band. They play classic pop and rock hits from the 70’s and 80’s that you're sure to know and love. Come for an afternoon of foot tapping and chair dancing music! Total concert will be approximately 2 hours with an intermission. Suggested donation of $5 per person to support the Wieting Theatre.

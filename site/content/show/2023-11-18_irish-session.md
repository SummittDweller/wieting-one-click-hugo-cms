Dï»¿es Moines Irish Session Band is an outgrowth of a traditional "seisiun" that has gathered regularly at venues throughout Central Iowa for over 35 years. Five members (including local Mark Bro) play a mix of jigs, rels, and songs sung in both English and Irish -- with a few innovative touches thrown in to keep the tradition alive and evolving.

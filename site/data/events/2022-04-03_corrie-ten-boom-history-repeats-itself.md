Corrie ten Boom is a one person drama by Evelyn Hinds where “Corrie” tells her amazing story of imprisonment in a Nazi death camp, her release, and later travel around the world telling her story. Evelyn is committed to telling the condensed story of Corrie and her family, as much as possible, in Corrie’s own words from her recordings or books.

Corrie ten Boom (1892-1983) was a Dutch woman who became part of the underground workers in Holland during the Holocaust. She is honored at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem as one of the Righteous Gentiles. She was honored by the Billy Graham Worldwide Pictures producing an award winning film of her life, “The Hiding Place.” Corrie’s family home is now a museum in Haarlem where people from all over the world come to see the home that the family used to hide the Jews from Hitler’s murderous plans.

Corrie was a gifted storyteller and her experiences and her faith have inspired generations! How did a simple Dutch woman without wealth or fame spend thirty-three years traveling around the world to sixty-four countries spreading her faith in God? Invite Evelyn to your platform or theater to share this compelling story that will touch your audience. The experience will educate about the Holocaust, inspire faith, and our critical mission of supporting the Jewish people!
